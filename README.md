## Techs:
The application was built a **React Native** and **expo**. Also used:
- **Tailwindcss** for styling;
- **Typescript** in data typing;
- **phosphor-react** for availability of icons;
- **Axios** for API requests;
- **Dayjs** for date manipulation;
- **Clsx** for manipulation of html classes in javascript files;
- **React-navigation** for create navigation between screens.

## Get started:
- With Git installed, in your terminal run the following command: *git clone https://github.com/VitinhoSouza/nlw-setup-mobile.git*;
- Enter the project folder and do: *npm install*. When all packages are installed, do *npx expo start* to start in development mode.
- Remember that to work correctly, it is necessary that the server is working correctly (Available in https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw-setup-ignite/tree/main/server). 
Modify the api baseURL if necessary.
